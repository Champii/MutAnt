# TODO

## V1
- Turn off logs by default
- Investigate scratchpad create on mainnet that doesnt like to have big data. Will need to revert to 2 phases create->update
- Don't get the full scratchpad during verification loops: client.scratchpad_check_existance()
- Implement the scratchpad_cost to display in advance 
- Public mutable uploads with scratchpad_put
- 'reserve' cli command to pre-reserve scratchpads
- Better low level abstractions
- Benchmarking different file sizes on testnet and mainnet
- Add a --no-verify flag to the cli to skip the verification loop

## V2
- Packed uploads on a single scratchpad for small data
- Public/Private immutable uploads (leverage retry/resume system)
